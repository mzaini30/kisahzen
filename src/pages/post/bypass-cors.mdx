For frontend developers, of course you are familiar with CORS errors like this:

> Access to fetch at 'https://google.com/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource . If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

So, basically we want to connect to the API but we can't because the server refuses.

How to handle it?

The trick is to add one of the following links in front of your API link:

- https://scrappy-php.herokuapp.com/?url=
- https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=
- https://cors.eu.org/
- https://cors-proxy.tk/?url=

Well, just give it a try...
